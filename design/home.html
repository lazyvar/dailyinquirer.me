                <p class="typewriter">All my life my parents sought to instill a hard working ethic in me. They both grew up relatively poor and have moved into the more luxurious middle class through pure determination. My father was a [HARD WORKING MIDDLE CLASS JOB HERE] and my mother was a nurse. They made sure we worked hard and learned the value of a dollar so we wouldn’t revert the family’s new found social status. Whenever I asked to buy anything they would always say “money doesn’t grow on trees you know!”. They were right, I had to earn my money. That is until one day a tree started sprouting dollar bills instead of leaves in our backyard...

                    It was my little brother Jack who first discovered trees new magical fruit. We had a large oak tree that was very climbable. [Jack would frequent the branches and swig like a chim - metaphor about jack climbing an being a monkey]. It was here he noticed a couple dollars bills at the end of the branches. At first he didn’t think anything of it. Oh naive Jack...
